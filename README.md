## Part One (1.0)
This program prompts the user to enter two integers and performs a series of calculations and checks. It demonstrates the use of basic input/output, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and the ternary operator in Java.

## Part TwoOne (2.1)
This program accepts numerical input from the user and performs various calculations, including computing the square, square root, and absolute value of each number. It also tracks the count of positive and negative numbers, calculates the sum and average of all entered numbers, and provides a summary report. The program runs in a loop, terminating when the user types "exit".

## Part TwoOne (2.2)
This Java program, **Sequence Analysis**, performs several tasks. For input handling, it prompts the user to enter two integers: `start` and `end`, ensuring that `start` is less than `end`. For counting and summation, it calculates and prints the count of integers between `start` and `end` (inclusive), the sum of all integers between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and the factorial of the sum obtained. The program implements methods for counting numbers, summing numbers, and calculating the factorial of a number. Additionally, it handles invalid inputs by prompting the user to re-enter valid values.
