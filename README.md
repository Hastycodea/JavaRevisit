## Part One (1.0)
This program prompts the user to enter two integers and performs a series of calculations and checks. It demonstrates the use of basic input/output, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and the ternary operator in Java.

## Part TwoOne (2.1)
This program accepts numerical input from the user and performs various calculations, including computing the square, square root, and absolute value of each number. It also tracks the count of positive and negative numbers, calculates the sum and average of all entered numbers, and provides a summary report. The program runs in a loop, terminating when the user types "exit".

## Part TwoOne (2.2)
This Java program, **Sequence Analysis**, performs several tasks. For input handling, it prompts the user to enter two integers: `start` and `end`, ensuring that `start` is less than `end`. For counting and summation, it calculates and prints the count of integers between `start` and `end` (inclusive), the sum of all integers between `start` and `end` (inclusive), and the factorial of the sum obtained. The program implements methods for counting numbers, summing numbers, and calculating the factorial of a number. Additionally, it handles invalid inputs by prompting the user to re-enter valid values.

## Part TwoThree (2.3)
This Java program prints a simplified representation of the American flag using asterisks (*) for the stars and equals signs (=) for the stripes. It demonstrates the use of loops, methods, and basic console output to create a pattern.

## Part Three (3.0)
This Java program demonstrates basic operations on an ArrayList of integers. It includes adding and removing elements, searching for a specific value, finding the index of the smallest number, calculating the sum of all numbers in the list, and printing the list of numbers. The program consists of a main method and three additional methods that perform specific tasks.

## Part ThreeOne (3.1)
The PartThreeOne program is a simple Java application that takes a sentence as input from the user, processes the sentence to extract words, checks for the presence of the word "java", and identifies the longest word in the sentence. The program utilizes basic Java constructs such as Scanner for input, ArrayList for dynamic array management, and simple control flow statements.
